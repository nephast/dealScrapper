# Simple Express server running web scrapping functions in the background.

## This server will run a scrapping task at startup and then every hour, saving the data to a PSQL database.

## The single endpoint will retrieve the transformed data saved from scrapping.

### To install:

Run `npm i` in the main folder.
You'll need `psql` installed on your machine.

### To run:

Run `npm start`
It will compile using Babel.
The server will restart at changes using Nodemon. (you can change that by updating the scrip in `package.json`).

## TODO:

- Error handling to be revisited to ensure edge cases are covered.

- Cron task to be run in the backgroung (including saving data).

- Maybe updating data instead of simply deleting the old one.

- Caching data for if a user try to call the endpoint while the scrapper is in action.
